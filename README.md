## What is BadLion Client
BadLion Client is a General Utility Client for 1.8.9 Minecraft which is very popular and makes gameplay much more enjoyable for PvP in 1.8.9

### Can you play Badlion Client crack ?
BadLion Client needs a premium Minecraft account to be used and does not work without it but this crack made by us (kinda, check CREDITS) that does not require a premium Minecraft account and can be used in launchers such as TLauncher or even the Official Minecraft Launcher.

Read the notes section of the README too

## Compatibility
Due to changes made by the SKLauncher & TLauncher devs, it is now no longer possible to use these launchers for badlionCrack. We recommend using [Tlegacy/LegacyLauncher](https://llaun.ch/en) for badlionCrack.

TLegacy (also known as Legacy Launcher) fully supports cracked and premium accounts.
